/**
 * This package contains the core classes and enums related to the Game Boy CPU instructions.
 * These components define the structure and behavior of instructions, including their
 * addressing modes, conditions, and interactions with the CPU.
 *
 * <p>The classes in this package are used to represent and manage the execution of
 * instructions in the Game Boy emulator, providing the foundation for accurate
 * emulation of the Game Boy's instruction set architecture (ISA).</p>
 *
 * <h2>Key Components:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Instruction:</b> Abstract class representing a CPU instruction.</li>
 *   <li><b>AddressMode:</b> Enum defining the various addressing modes used by instructions.</li>
 *   <li><b>InstructionCondition:</b> Enum representing the conditions under which instructions are executed.</li>
 *   <li><b>RegisterType:</b> Enum representing the CPU registers used in instructions.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This package is part of the Game Boy emulator project and is designed to provide
 * a flexible and extensible framework for implementing and managing CPU instructions.</p>
