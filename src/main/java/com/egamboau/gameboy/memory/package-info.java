/**
 * This package contains classes and components related to the memory system of the Game Boy.
 * It includes the implementation of the memory bus, memory regions, and constants
 * that define the Game Boy's memory map.
 *
 * <p>The classes in this package are responsible for managing memory interactions,
 * including reading and writing to various memory regions such as ROM, RAM, VRAM,
 * and special-purpose registers. These components work together to provide an
 * accurate simulation of the Game Boy's memory architecture.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Key Components:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Bus:</b> Represents the memory bus, facilitating communication between the CPU, cartridge, and memory regions.</li>
 *   <li><b>MemoryMapConstants:</b> Defines constants for the Game Boy's memory map, specifying address ranges for different regions.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This package is part of the Game Boy emulator project and is designed to provide
 * a robust and extensible framework for simulating the Game Boy's memory system.</p>
